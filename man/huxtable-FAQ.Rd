\description{
A FAQ of common issues.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item LaTeX output isn't working.
}

Have you installed the LaTeX packages you need? LaTeX packages are different from R packages. Run
\code{\link[=check_latex_dependencies]{check_latex_dependencies()}} to find out if you are missing any. Then install them using your
system's LaTeX management application. Or you can try \code{\link[=install_latex_dependencies]{install_latex_dependencies()}}.
\itemize{
\item Numbers in my cells look weird!
}

You can change numeric formatting using \code{\link[=number_format]{number_format()}}. Base R options like
\code{\link[base:options]{scipen}} usually have no effect.
\itemize{
\item I ran \code{caption(ht) <- "Something"} and got an error message:
}\preformatted{Error in UseMethod("caption<-") :
no applicable method for 'caption<-' applied to an object of class "c('huxtable', 'data.frame')"
}

You may have loaded another package with a \code{caption} method, e.g. "xtable". Try loading huxtable
after xtable.
\itemize{
\item My tables aren't centered correctly (LaTeX).
}

Try adjusting \code{width(ht)}.
\itemize{
\item How can I change the font size, font etc. of captions?
}

There are no direct commands for this. You have to use raw HTML/TeX/other commands within the
caption itself. For example to have a bold caption in HTML, you might do something like:\preformatted{set_caption(jams, "<b>Jam Prices</b>")

}
\itemize{
\item How do I refer to tables in bookdown?
}

As of version 4.3.0, this is handled automatically for you. Just
set the label using \code{\link[=label]{label()}}, then in markdown text do e.g.:\preformatted{\\@ref(tab:my-table-label).

}
\itemize{
\item I have another problem.
}

If you have a bug - i.e. a problem with the software - or have a feature request, please report
it to \url{https://github.com/hughjonesd/huxtable/issues}. Otherwise, ask a question on
\href{https://stackoverflow.com}{StackOverflow} or \url{https://community.rstudio.com}. That way, other
people will benefit from the answers you get.
\itemize{
\item Can I email you directly?
}

I'd rather you asked on a public website. If you then email me a link, I may be able to help.
